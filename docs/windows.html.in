    <h1>Windows port</h1>

    <p>
      There is no official Windows port of libvirt-php available yet but if you want to write the Windows port
      we would appreciate it.</p>
    <p>Since libvirt is known to be running on Windows (please
      refer to <a href="http://libvirt.org/windows.html">Information on libvirt Windows port</a>) it should
      be possible and reasonable to create the libvirt-php port for Windows based operating systems, i.e. in
      the form of Windows dynamic linked library for Windows version of PHP.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparations for libvirt-php Windows port</h2>
    <p>
      If you are interested in writing Windows port you should download the current codebase from the GIT repository
      and create a patch adding the Windows port itself. Before you do so you have to compile libvirt on Windows
      to be able to access it using the Windows dynamic linked (DLL) library. For more information about getting
      libvirt client to install on Windows box please refer to <a href="http://libvirt.org/windows.html">Information on libvirt Windows port</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>Reference materials on writing Windows libraries/applications under Linux</h2>
    <p>
      If you seek for some reference information about Windows application/libraries programming under the Linux operating system please refer to
      author's programming guide at <a href="http://migsoft.net/linux-winprog.html">Windows programming under Linux programming guide</a>.
