    <h1>Libvirt-php</h1>

    <p>libvirt-php, originally called php-libvirt, is a project that was started by Radek Hladik in 2010 to integrate libvirt support to PHP.</p>
    <p>In February 2011 the binding has been moved to libvirt.org site and it's currently maintained by Red Hat and current version is heavily
       based on Radek's original version. </p>

    <h2>What is libvirt-php?</h2>
    <p>libvirt-php is a php module that provides PHP bindings for libvirt virtualization toolkit and therefore you can access libvirt directly from
       your PHP scripts with no need to have virt-manager or libvirt-based CLI/GUI tools installed</p>

    <h2>How to use libvirt-php</h2>
    <p>Once you have the libvirt-php module loaded in your PHP configuration you can test it's presence using a standard PHPInfo() output where
       you could be able to see libvirt extension information if enabled or you can use a simple PHP script like:</p>
    <pre>&lt;&#63;php
    print_r( libvirt_version() );
&#63;&gt;</pre>
    <p>If you have libvirt-php binding installed and binding is working successfully you should be seeing following output to your console or webpage
    (this depends on version of PHP you're using - whether cli-based interface to just test it or you're running the script inside of your webserver):</p>
    <pre>Array
(
    [libvirt.release] =&gt; 3
    [libvirt.minor] =&gt; 8
    [libvirt.major] =&gt; 0
    [connector.version] =&gt; 0.4.1
    [type.release] =&gt; 1
    [type.minor] =&gt; 0
    [type.major] =&gt; 3
)
</pre>
    <p>Fields in this output are saying what version of libvirt, hypervisor and libvirt-php you are using. The fields beginning with <i>libvirt.</i> are
    libvirt daemon related, those with <i>type.</i> prefix are hypervisor related and <i>connector.version</i> is referring to libvirt-php since libvirt-php
    is just a connector to libvirt daemon so therefore connector.</p>
    <p>If you don't have the extension installed properly you won't be able to see the extension there or even you may see error page instead if
    PHP configuration is bad and your PHP or Apache dies on it.</p>
